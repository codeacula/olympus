# Task 6

## Task Details

Scaffold the Application project by creating Abstractions and Common folders. The Application layer orchestrates commands/queries and defines interfaces like ISemanticKernelOrchestrator and IEventPublisher.

Implementation Plan:

1. Create Abstractions/ and Common/ folders in Olympus.Application.
2. Add subfolders (Ai, Ecs, Gateways) under Abstractions and define empty interfaces (e.g., ISemanticKernelOrchestrator).
3. Add Result<TSuccess,TError> and Option<T> in Common/Types.
4. Stub out ValidationBehavior.cs in Common/Behaviors.
5. Implement DependencyInjection.cs for future handler registration.

Acceptance Criteria:

- The Application builds successfully.
- All abstraction interfaces are present.
- The Dependency Injection class compiles without errors.

## Execution Plan

### Step 1: Create Folder Structure

Create the required `Abstractions` and `Common` folders in `Olympus.Application`, including subfolders `Ai`, `Ecs`, `Gateways` under `Abstractions`, and `Types`, `Behaviors` under `Common`.

#### Step 1: Code Plan

- Add folders: `src/Olympus.Application/Abstractions/Ai`, `Ecs`, `Gateways`, and `src/Olympus.Application/Common/Types`, `Behaviors`.
- No code yet, just structure.
- Test: Confirm folders exist in the project.

### Step 2: Define Core Abstraction Interfaces

Add empty interfaces: `ISemanticKernelOrchestrator` (in `Abstractions/Ai`), `IEventPublisher` (in `Abstractions/Gateways`), and any other required by the plan.

#### Step 2: Code Plan

- Create `ISemanticKernelOrchestrator.cs` in `Abstractions/Ai`.
- Create `IEventPublisher.cs` in `Abstractions/Gateways`.
- Interfaces should be empty for now.
- Test: Compile to ensure interfaces are recognized.

### Step 3: Add Common Types

Implement `Result<TSuccess,TError>` and `Option<T>` as generic types in `Common/Types`.

#### Step 3: Code Plan

- Create `Result.cs` and `Option.cs` in `Common/Types`.
- Implement as per project conventions (immutable, explicit error handling).
- Test: Add unit tests in `Olympus.Tests.Application` to verify construction and usage.

### Step 4: Stub Validation Behavior

Add a stub for `ValidationBehavior.cs` in `Common/Behaviors` for future pipeline behaviors.

#### Step 4: Code Plan

- Create `ValidationBehavior.cs` in `Common/Behaviors`.
- Stub out class with a comment placeholder.
- Test: Ensure file compiles and is included in the project.

### Step 5: Add Dependency Injection Setup

Create `DependencyInjection.cs` in the root of `Olympus.Application/Common` to register handlers and abstractions.

#### Step 5: Code Plan

- Create `DependencyInjection.cs` in `Common`.
- Add a static class with a method for service registration (empty for now).
- Test: Reference from API or test project to ensure it compiles.

## Changelog

- Initial task file created for Application layer scaffolding (Task 6).

- Added empty interfaces: ISemanticKernelOrchestrator, IEventPublisher.
- Implemented Result<TSuccess,TError> and Option<T> as abstract records with Success/Failure and Some/None cases.
- Stubbed ValidationBehavior.cs in Common/Behaviors.
- Added DependencyInjection.cs in Common with extension method for service registration.
- Added unit tests for Result and Option types in Olympus.Tests.Application/ResultOptionTests.cs.
