# Olympus

**Olympus** is a next-generation AI-powered tabletop platform that simulates immersive narrative campaigns through a modular, event-sourced architecture. Players interact via Discord while AI Game Masters generate responsive narratives, powered by Semantic Kernel, Redis state management, and a layered C# application.

## üîß Architecture

Olympus is built using:

- **CQRS + Event Sourcing** (via Marten/PostgreSQL) for domain modeling
- **Entity Component System (ECS)** using Redis for real-time world state
- **AI Integration** using Semantic Kernel plugins and prompt orchestration
- **Discord Bot** for player interaction
- **Vue.js Portal** (planned) for campaign and world admin

> See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and [`docs/ai.md`](docs/ai.md)

## üöÄ MVP: AI Narrative Loop

The initial MVP enables a single player to narrate actions via a Discord command. Olympus returns AI-generated narrative results based on short-term memory, chance, and character context.
