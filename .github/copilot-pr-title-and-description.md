# GitHub Copilot - PR Title and Description Generation for Olympus

You are generating the title and description for a Pull Request (PR) in the Olympus project. Your goal is to provide a clear, concise summary that helps reviewers understand the changes by populating the project's PR template.

1. **Primary Guidance**:
    * The general coding standards, architectural principles, and commit message conventions are defined in the main `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. These will inform the content of the PR.
    * The PR description MUST follow the structure of the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file. Reproduce all sections from that template.

2. **PR Title Generation**:
    * **Format**: `EMOJI <type>(<scope>): <Concise Subject>`
    * **EMOJI**: Select an appropriate emoji based on the primary `<type>`:
        * `feat`: ✨ | `fix`: 🐛 | `perf`: ⚡️ | `refactor`: ♻️ | `docs`: 📚 | `test`: ✅ | `chore`: 🧹 | `style`: 🎨
        * If multiple types, choose for the most significant.
    * **`<type>`**: Determine the primary Conventional Commit type from the branch's commits.
    * **`<scope>` (Optional)**: Identify the primary area of change.
    * **`<Concise Subject>`**: Brief, imperative summary (max 72 chars). Example: `✨ feat(GameSession): Implement narrative turn processing`

3. **PR Description Generation (Populating `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`)**:
    Analyze the commits in the branch and the code changes to populate each section of the template:

    * **`## 🧠 Summary`**:
        * Provide a 2-4 sentence explanation of what the PR achieves, why it's made, and its impact.
        * Synthesize information from commit messages and the overall diff.

    * **`## 🔗 Related Issue(s)`**:
        * Scan commit messages for keywords like `Closes #<issue_number>`, `Fixes #<issue_number>`, or `Relates to #<issue_number>`.
        * List these clearly. If none found but seems relevant, prompt developer: "Developer: Please link any relevant issues."

    * **`## 🛠️ Implementation Highlights (Optional)`**:
        * Based on the code changes, identify significant architectural decisions, new patterns/libraries introduced, or core components heavily modified.
        * Suggest 1-2 bullet points if applicable. Examples:
            * "Identified new service: `src/Olympus.Application/Services/NewServiceName.cs`."
            * "Major refactoring in `src/Olympus.Domain/Aggregates/SomeAggregate.cs`."
        * If no major highlights, suggest: "No major architectural highlights for this PR." or leave blank for developer.

    * **`## 🧪 How to Test These Changes`**:
        * **Infer from Tests**: If new unit/integration tests are added, suggest steps related to running them or describe what they cover. (e.g., "Run `NewFeatureTests.cs` to verify X, Y, Z.")
        * **Infer from API Changes**: If API endpoints are added/modified, suggest how to call them (e.g., "Send POST to `/api/new-endpoint` with payload { ... } and expect 200 OK.").
        * **General Logic**: For other changes, try to formulate logical steps based on the code's purpose.
        * **Prompt if Unclear**: If specific steps are hard to infer, suggest: "Developer: Please provide specific manual validation steps for these changes."
        * Always include placeholders for "Setup", "Action", and "Verification".

    * **`## ⚠️ Potential Impact & Risks (Optional)`**:
        * **Scan for Breaking Changes**: Look for `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit messages. Also, analyze changes to public API signatures, database schemas (if visible), or core configuration.
        * **Performance**: Note if changes involve loops, complex queries, or resource-intensive operations that might impact performance.
        * **Dependencies**: Note if new external dependencies are added or existing ones significantly changed.
        * If none obvious, suggest: "No specific impacts or risks identified beyond the described changes." or leave blank for developer.

    * **`## ✅ Checklist`**:
        * Reproduce the full checklist from `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
        * Add a note: "Developer: Please verify each item in the checklist before merging."

4. **Overall Tone**:
    * Clear, professional, and helpful.
    * If Copilot cannot confidently fill a section, it should state that and prompt the developer to complete it.
