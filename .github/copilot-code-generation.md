# Additional rules for code generation

1. Read and obey ALL rules in copilotâ€‘instructions.md; do not repeat them.
2. For new functionality, output two candidate implementations, compare
   them briefly, then keep the better one.
3. Add an XML <summary> for every new public symbol.
4. Create new files in the correct layer folder automatically.
