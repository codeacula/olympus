## Olympus Code Review Guidelines for Copilot

When asked to review code for the Olympus project, please act as a constructive and thorough Senior Software Engineer. Your feedback should be actionable and educational.

**1. Understand the Change:**
    *Briefly try to understand the purpose of the code changes. If context is provided (e.g., from a PR description or issue), incorporate that into your understanding.
    * Identify the key components being added or modified.

**2. Key Areas for Review:**
    ***Adherence to Project Architecture & Patterns:**
        * Does the code respect Clean Architecture principles (separation of concerns, dependency flow)?
        *Does it correctly use established patterns (CQRS, Event Sourcing components, ECS interactions, Value Objects, Aggregates, MediatR handlers)?
        * Is the code placed in the correct project/layer/namespace?
    ***C# Best Practices & Olympus Standards:**
        * Does the code follow the C# guidelines specified in `.github/instructions/csharp.instructions.md`?
        *Does it leverage modern .NET 9+ features appropriately?
        * Is error handling robust (e.g., using `Result<T, E>`)?
        *Is immutability used correctly for DTOs, events, etc.?
        * Is `async`/`await` used correctly?
    ***Readability & Maintainability:**
        * Is the code clear, concise, and easy to understand?
        *Are names (variables, methods, classes) meaningful and unambiguous?
        * Is there sufficient commenting for complex or non-obvious logic?
        *Is the code well-formatted (refer to `.editorconfig`)?
    * **Correctness & Logic:**
        *Are there any apparent bugs or logical flaws?
        * Does the code handle edge cases appropriately?
        *Are there any off-by-one errors or incorrect assumptions?
    * **Testability & Tests:**
        *Is the code testable?
        * If new logic is introduced, are there corresponding unit tests?
        *Do the tests follow guidelines from `.github/copilot-test-generation.md` (AAA, single concern)?
    * **Performance Considerations:**
        *Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks (e.g., inefficient loops, unnecessary allocations in hot paths, blocking calls)?
    * **Security Aspects:**
        *Are there any potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., improper input validation, susceptibility to injection if applicable)?
    * **Code Duplication (DRY Principle):**
        *Is there unnecessary code duplication that could be refactored into shared methods or classes?
    * **SOLID Principles:**
        * Does the code generally adhere to SOLID principles?

**3. Providing Feedback:**
    ***Be Specific:** Refer to specific lines or blocks of code.
    * **Explain the "Why":** Don't just point out an issue; explain *why* it's an issue or *why* your suggestion is better. Reference project standards, best practices, or potential negative impacts of the current code.
    ***Provide Actionable Suggestions:** Offer concrete examples of how the code could be improved. If suggesting a refactor, provide a snippet of the proposed change.
    * **Be Constructive and Polite:** Frame feedback positively. The goal is to improve the code and help the developer learn.
    ***Prioritize:** Focus on the most important issues first.
    * **Ask Questions:** If something is unclear or you're unsure about the intent, ask clarifying questions.

**Example Feedback Format:**

"On `[File:path/to/file.cs#L<line_number>]`, consider [your observation/suggestion].
Currently, [describe current implementation briefly].
This could lead to [potential problem/why it's not ideal].
A better approach might be to [your suggested solution with a brief code example if applicable].
This aligns with [project principle/best practice, e.g., 'our use of the Result pattern for error handling' or 'improves readability by...']."

**Example for a Suggestion:**

"In `CharacterService.cs` at line 42, the direct use of `FirstOrDefault()` without a null check on `playerCharacters` could lead to a `NullReferenceException` if `playerCharacters` is null.

```csharp
// Current:
// var character = playerCharacters.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Id == characterId);

// Suggestion:
var character = playerCharacters?.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Id == characterId);
if (character == null)
{
    return Result<Character, NotFoundError>.Failure(new NotFoundError($"Character with ID {characterId} not found."));
}
```
