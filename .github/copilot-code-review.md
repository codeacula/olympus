# GitHub Copilot - Code Review Guidelines for Olympus

You are assisting with a code review for the Olympus project. Your goal is to identify deviations from best practices, architectural principles, and coding standards, then suggest improvements.

1. **Primary Guidance**: Your most comprehensive set of instructions is in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. You MUST thoroughly understand and use this document as the basis for your review. Pay attention to ALL sections, as they define the expected standards for this repository.

2. **Core Review Focus (Based on Main Instructions)**:
    When reviewing code, critically assess against these key areas detailed in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:
    * **Section 1: Core Architectural & Design Principles**:
        * Verify strict Clean Architecture layer adherence (no outward dependencies from Domain/Application).
        * Check CQRS command/query naming and handler structure.
        * Ensure Event Sourcing principles are applied correctly for relevant entities.
        * Confirm proper use of `Result<T>` and `Option<T>`.
    * **Section 2: C# Language & Coding Conventions**:
        * Ensure use of modern C# (records, file-scoped namespaces, etc.).
        * Check for XML documentation on public APIs.
        * Verify logging uses source-generated `LoggerMessage`.
        * Promote immutability.
    * **Section 4: Testing**:
        * Confirm new logic is adequately covered by unit tests (AAA pattern, naming conventions).
        * Ensure tests are in the correct projects.
    * **Section 7: What Copilot Must Avoid**:
        * Actively look for and flag any practices listed in this section (e.g., hard-coded config, direct `DateTime.Now` usage, God objects).

3. **Providing Feedback**:
    * **Explain Clearly**: For each suggestion, first explain the *reason* behind it, referencing the specific principle or convention from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` if applicable.
    * **Show Diff**: Provide a concise `diff` snippet showing the suggested change:

      ```diff
      - // Old problematic code
      + // *New* improved code
      ```

    * **Be Constructive**: Frame suggestions to help improve code quality and maintainability.

4. **Output Format for Suggestions**:
    Please format your review comments as follows:

    ```markdown
      ### Suggestion 1: [Brief Title of Suggestion]

      **Reason**: [Explain why this change is recommended, referencing .github/copilot-instructions.md if relevant. For example: "Violates Clean Architecture: Domain layer should not reference Infrastructure."]

      **Current Code Snippet**:
        ```csharp
        // Show 1-3 lines of the existing code with the issue
        ```

      **Suggested Change**:

        ```diff
        - // old code line(s)
        + // new code line(s)
        ```
    ```

    (Repeat for each suggestion)

5. **Developer Workflow Reminders (for the human developer)**:
    While you, Copilot, focus on the code itself, remind the developer to:
    * Run `dotnet format` and any static analyzers locally.
    * Ensure all unit tests pass before and after applying suggestions.
    * Keep the overall pull request size manageable (e.g., target diff â‰¤500 lines unless justified).

Your primary role is to help maintain the high quality and architectural integrity of the Olympus codebase by meticulously applying the rules in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
